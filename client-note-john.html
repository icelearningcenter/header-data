His job requires repetitive use of dominant RUE managing cranes, heavy equipment, and screwing nails into objects. He presented with onset of pain in the right upper forearm around the lateral epicondyle. The pain progressed to the point of no longer being able to utilize functional grasp with dominant RUE. He got to the point of being unable to use a screw driver or maneuver with torque movements. Unable to put a screw in or twist his hand. He began using his non-dominant hand because the pain became so bad. He has tried taking NSAIDs for pain relief, but they do not eliminate the pain.
